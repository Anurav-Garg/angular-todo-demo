# Angular Todo Demo

A demo frontend for a to-do app, made using Angular, with vanilla CSS. [Hosted with Vercel here.](https://angular-todo-demo.vercel.app/)

Stores all to-do's in the browser's local storage.

There is no backend/database connectivity. Does not (yet?) work for phones or similar screen ratios.
